An improved encounter tables tool.
Multiroll encounters, easy format, auto `!battle` support.

**Dependencies [Required]**
- `!battle` by _Derixyleth#0636_ | [Avrae Development Server](http://invite.avrae.io/)

**Rolling Encounters**
`!denc [entry] <location> <tier#> [entry #]`

EX: `!denc arctic 1`

To view a specific entry, simply add the following:
EX: `!denc entry arctic 1 24`

**Setting Tables to Use**
DEnc uses a `svar` or `cvar` named `DencEncounterSources` to assign the sources for rolling. `!svar|cvar DencEncounterSources ["gvar1","gvar2"]`
Will always use a Personal var if available, then Server, then it's default.
